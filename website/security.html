			<h1>Security</h1>
			<p><em>Note: Cryptocat is currently Beta software.<br />The Security page is currently incomplete and will be elaborated once the software is considered stable.</em></p>

			<h2 id="overview">Encryption Overview</h2>
			<p>
				Cryptocat uses a TextSecure-based encryption protocol that combines a forward-secure ratchet with a zero round-trip authenticated key exchange. As a transport layer for encrypted messages, Cryptocat adopts the <a href="https://conversations.im/xeps/multi-end.html" target="_blank">OMEMO Multi-End Message and Object Encryption</a> standard, which also gives Cryptocat multi-device support and allows for offline messaging.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every Cryptocat device owns a long-term <span class="code">identityKeyPair</span> which helps with the establishment of the initial authenticated key exchange. This key pair also serves to sign the device's <span class="code">signedPreKey</span>, an ephemeral public key that also is mixed into the authenticated key exchange. The <span class="code">signedPreKey</span> is also shipped with 100, unsigned, one-time-use <span class="code">preKey</span>s, and is regenerated and re-signed every week. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Between messages, Cryptocat maintains a forward-secure ratcheting chain that derives new ephemeral key pairs that keep their chain of authenticity by mixing in with the authenticated key exchanged via a Hash-Based Key Derivation Function (HKDF).
			</p>
			<h3>Primitives</h3>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li><em>AES</em> is used in Galois Counter Mode (GCM) for authenticated symmetric encryption with added data.</li>
					<li><em>X25519</em> is used for all Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) operations. A four-way ECDH handshake is used for the initial authenticated key exchange and further ECDH operations are routinely performed for <span class="code">preKey</span> generation and message ratcheting.</li>
					<li><em>ED25519</em> is used for generating <span class="code">identityKeyPair</span> and for signing and verifying the <span class="code">signedPreKey</span>, but is otherwise unused throughout the protocol.</li>
					<li><em>SHA256</em> is used as the standard hashing function and as the underlying hash function for the HKDF.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Threat Model</h3>
			<p>
				Cryptocat makes the following assumptions:
				<ul>
					<li><em>Untrusted network</em>: We assume that an attacker controls the network and so can intercept, tamper with and inject network messages.</li>
					<li><em>Long-term key compromise</em>: We assume that an attacker may at some point compromise the long-term <span class="code">identityKeyPair</span> of a participant.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Security Goals</h3>
			<p>
				Given our threat model, Cryptocat aims to accomplish the following security goals:
				<ul>
					<li><em>Secrecy</em>: A message sent between buddies can only be decrypted between these buddies.</li>
					<li><em>Authenticity</em>: If Alice receive an apparently valid message from Bob, then Bob must have sent this message to Alice.</li>
					<li><em>Indistinguishability</em>: If Alice randomly chooses between two messages of the same size and sends only one to Bob, an attacker cannot determine which message was sent.</li>
					<li><em>Forward secrecy</em>: If Alice sends a message to Bob and both Alice and Bob's <span class="code">identityKeyPair</span>s are susbsequently compromised, this message retains its Secrecy property.</li>
					<li><em>Future secrecy</em>: If Alice sends a first message to Bob, receives a reply from Bob, and then sends a second message to Bob, Alice's second message remains secret even if her keys for the first message are compromised.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h2 id="misc">Miscellaneous Security Features</h2>
			<p>
				Aside of the message encryption protocol, Cryptocat adopts the following security features in order to provide a generally more robust experience across the client:
				<ul>
					<li><em>Authenticated installers</em>: Cryptocat client installation packages are authenticated using Authenticode on Windows, <span class="code">gpg2</span> on Linux and Apple code signing on Mac.</li>
					<li><em>Signed updates</em>: In addition to installer authentication, Cryptocat's built-in update downloader will run an independent signature verification on all downloads.</li>
					<li><em>Certificate pinning</em>: Cryptocat will check for a "known-good" TLS certificate before initiating a connection to the Cryptocat XMPP server.</li>
					<li><em>Device management</em>: Users are given the option of independently verifying their buddies' device lists and are notified when a buddy's device list is modified.</li>
				</ul>
